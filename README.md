Ultimate Manager developer challenge
====================================
At Ultimate Manager we want to challenge the way people consume football by creating an awesome second screen experience(1).

**Objective**: To develop a small statistical dashboard to be used as a second screen.

**Goals**:

1. Show an overview of the earnings for all players
2. Show the actions of each player during the match

**Bonus goals**:

1. Reponsive design.
2. Novel ways to show the actions.
3. Great UX.
4. Beautiful visual design.
5. Proposing future work using github issues/milestones.

The data files available are located in this repository. Clone the repo and use it as a base for the project. Feel free to move stuff around. When ready for review, push the repo to your github account and send us the link.

Aim for the completion of the objectives first, then see if you have time for the bonus goals.
The challenge shouldn't take much more than around 10 hours.
We will of course only use your work with your permission and you are free to use it for your portfolio.

**Available data:**

The available data consist of 3 files: league.json, squads.json, actions.json. As the filename implies, the data is encoded as JSON.
